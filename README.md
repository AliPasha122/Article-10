Despite advancements in science and technology, the issue of microplastics in tap water
remains unresolved. Microplastics—tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size—have
infiltrated the water supply, posing significant health risks. They originate from synthetic
fibers, degraded plastic waste, and industrial processes. Traditional water filtration methods,
including sand filtration and reverse osmosis, fail to efficiently remove microplastics, leading
to their accumulation in human bodies and ecosystems.Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, exhibits
exceptional properties such as high surface area, mechanical strength, and molecular-level
filtration capabilities. A graphene-based filtration system can be designed to efficiently
remove microplastics from tap water using the approaches described in this article.
